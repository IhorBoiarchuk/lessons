						The lands that make up Ukraine’s modern territory are home to thousands of 
						mysteries and the stories of hundreds of peoples, states and cultures. 
						In the history of Ukraine, heroic and dramatic plots have taken place here 
						over the centuries – the formation and destruction of civilizations, the 
						intermingling and confrontations of nations, wars, revolutions, cultural 
						decline and revival.Historians have long been drawn to choosing metaphors to describe this 
						region. It has been called ‘the gates of Europe’ as many people, cultures,
						tastes and religions have entered Europe through Ukrainian lands. It has 
						also been regarded as ‘the cradle of many peoples and cultures’ because 
						Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, Tatars, Belarusians, Roma, Bulgarians, Greeks, 
						Armenians, Germans and Romanians lived and worked alongside one another 
						for centuries.We learn from Herodotus that the Scythians, the ancient nomadic people, 
						lived here a few centuries before Christ. They traded with Greeks and 
						fought with Persians. Compatriots of the Greek father of history loved 
						<mark>Ukraine’s Black Sea</mark>  coast as well. When the brilliance of 
						the ancient civilization dimmed, the Slavs entered the historic arena.
						Archaeological research shows that their ancestral homeland was
						the <a target="_blank" href="#">Ukrainian land.</a>

						<span>Ukrainian lands</span>  fell under the rule of neighbouring states

						the 16th to the end of the 18th century, gathering the territories of 
						modern Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia and western Rus               
                  At the same time, the Ukrainian phenomenon of free chivalry reached its 
						apogee, and Cossacks (‘free men’, from Turkic languages) appeared in the
						European arena. For a while, they even managed to create their own state
						called Hetmanate (Zaporizhzhia Host). Cossack detachments took part in 
						almost all the great wars in the region, either as an independent 
						military force or as mercenaries. Theyhad their own unique customs,
						self-government and an original <a target="_blank" href="#">military tradition.</a>

					<p class="text">
						The <span>20th century</span>  began in a stormy way for Ukraine 
						— millions of people were thrown into the chaos of World War I.
                  Witnessing the downfall of the age-old empires, Ukraine made an 
						attempt to build its own nation-state in 1917-1921. Together with
						the Poles, Ukrainians managed to protect Europe from communism and 
						defeat the Russian Bolshevik troops near Warsaw.
                  Poland resisted, while Ukraine was reconquered by its neighbours. 
						Until 1991, Ukrainians lived under the power of the totalitarian 
						regime as a constituent part of the communist USSR. It was a 
						difficult time with terrible tragedies and challenges — <br>forced
						collectivization, genocide-Holodomor, The Great Terror, Holocaust, 
						deportations, GULAG, punitive psychiatry, Soviet military interventions,
						the Chornobyl disaster, among other events, that took the lives of 
						millions of Ukrainians who represented many different nationalities.
                  Since 1991, more than 40 million people of different nationalities and 
						religions had enjoyed peace in Ukraine until 2014 when Russia illegally 
						occupied Crimea and sent its troops over the border in Ukraine’s Donbas
						region. Today, Russia carries out aggression and hybrid warfare against
						Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, which has already resulted in 
						14,000 people killed and more than 33,500 wounded, continuously building 
						up its military capacities and drawing armed forces to the Ukrainian 
						border.<mark>On February 21 2022</mark> , Russia made a decision to recognise 
						the ‘independence’ of the quasi-entities it had created in the temporarily
						occupied territories of Ukraine — the so-called ‘Luhansk People’s Republic’
						and <a target="_blank" title="Donetsk" href="#">‘Donetsk People’s Republic.’</a>
